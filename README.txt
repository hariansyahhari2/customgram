These app are using react native with expo server as front end and firebase as backend to store database.
How to get started: 
- Pull the file
- Open cmd, go to app directory
- Run "npm install" to install all dependencies (You should install npm first, run with "npm install -g expo-cli")
- Run "npm start"

Note:
This app still undone and more features are in making process. Here is what we can do with this app:
- Register with email and password
- Login with email and password
- Upload profile picture while register
- Show user name and profile picture in profile page
- Post image and caption (Post has stored in firebase, but hasn't displayed on the Home Screen)

Here is the list of feature that needed to be done:
- Showing Home Screen from firestore database, the apps still using tempFile
- Chatting features
- Notification features
- Folowing features
- Like and comment features

I'm new with firebase, so I make this portfolio to get started with firebase
